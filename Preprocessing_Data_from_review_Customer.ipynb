            "terrible experience with british airways i booked a flight with ba to travel from gibraltar to london heathrow on may 10 2023 my flight was scheduled to leave at 4 00 p m in the afternoon i had originally planned on leaving my luggage at heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin s place en route to gib airport a few hours prior to departure i checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled i had a connecting flight booked with westjet from london heathrow to vancouver the following day and i had to make that flight so it was imperative that i got to london i checked the ba website and couldn t find any other flights with them that would work so unfortunately i made the mistake of requesting a refund i managed to find a flight out of malaga that got me into london just after 10 00 p m so i booked that and then called british airways as i wanted to discuss compensation that s when they advised me that because i had requested a refund they used the phrase abandoned travel with them they were not prepared to do anything for me apparently i should have called them first and then they would have made the arrangements of course they don t explain that on their website they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed and even when i plead my case with the agent at malaga airport and then followed up with customer relations several times via email they flat out refused to budge i had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip once this incident happened i ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to london from malaga i e different airport than the one i had originally booked from and because the luggage storage facility at heathrow had closed by the time i eventually arrived i ended up booking a night at a hotel since i couldn t travel by train to my cousin s place any longer 3 bags in tow and i didn t want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up this cost me another £125 in room and meal costs all ba ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5 000 free avios a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses despite trying to explain to them why i requested the refund instead of calling them first they wouldn t budge very easy for them to say what i should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren t the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours i pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens and that way they would never encounter this problem my feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake i did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money i ve been an executive club member for years and they simply didn t care they said there was nothing they could do i m sure if one of the ba executive s friends or family members had gone through this staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right i used to be a fan of ba but they have really gone downhill in my opinion once i used up my remaining avios and travel credit i will cancel my executive club membership and never fly with them again\n",

            "i will never travel with british airways again i spent over 10 000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the uk first the boeing 787 9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy the seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half they have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet which wakes up that passenger the whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you second the food was disgusting third the service terrible fourth the toilet was tiny fifth the inflight screen was fixed and too high so i could not see anything sixth their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and i had to pay more no free airport transfers with british airways seventh the charging points did not work the second leg to london was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle that was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece this means that you are sleeping on a metal bar the seat where there is a gap in the seat to add insult to injury i now find that both flights back to sydney are on the small plane to book a seat before check in is 170 i paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left this is why i got the worst seat in the house going out this is the most appalling airline service i have ever encountered there is no point paying for business class in british airways\n",

            "regarding the aircraft and seat the business class seats on this flight were pretty good all were of the suite type where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy the downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple its quite difficult to interact there is ample storage and usb charging ports the seat is pretty comfortable as someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights this was one of the only times i ve been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there the amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines the leather toiletry bag was quite nice though no slippers only a pair of socks the restrooms on the flight are very small and don t provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines no free wi fi in business class is not acceptable another example of ba s penny pinching in recent years regarding the staff and customer service poor inattentive beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight i had to go and find an attendant and ask there was also no offer of any snacks rude at times my partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty the attendant was incredibly rude in response this left us shocked different customers seem to receive a different quality of service a customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were whether they needed anything etc whereas my partner and i were not afforded the same level of personal service this is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service the food was pretty bad i had risotto while my partner had chicken both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge the vegetables were discoloured and flavourless the bread was nice though the breakfast wasn t much better summary ba has become the ryanair of long haul the customer service is way below what i would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat you pay a premium price for a very average service if there are other options available i would choose them over ba these days\n",

            "had the worst experience the flight from london to toronto got delayed and we missed the connecting flight to halifax we were four including an infant and a toddler aged 4 years despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful we waited for an hour to get them to talk to us and at 12 am they told us they have not booked any hotel for us to stay that night and asked to go search for a hotel on your own very nice of you british airways at least you guys should have given some consideration to the travelers who travel with children and booked some accommodation we will not to travel on this airline again\n",
            "the ground staff were not helpful felt like all they wanted to do was rush us to check in and then all passengers needed up waiting in a holding area for a bus anyway travelling with a child with a disability was a nightmare with british airways logged a complaint and it took almost four weeks to answer lost some of our luggage it was not a good experience\n",
            "second time ba premium economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in hong kong this was a very pleasant flight seats are spacious and comfortable in premium economy in this layout attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was good they communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind a very pleasant experience in ba premium economy after a major disappointment in club world earlier this year\n",
            "they changed our flights from brussels to london heathrow to lax on 4 16 2023 we paid extra to choose our seats since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought they seated us in totally different seats i asked the check in employee she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight from london to lax was worse nobody in the airport help us employees from ba told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal 3 and sleep there finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel it was a nightmare this airline we missed one day work and ba didn’t return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seats\n",

            "worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for british airways so many issues with getting from one destination to the other had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties i wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe 50 on a 600 flight needless to say these will go to waste as i refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them it was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face i will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive the most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss\n",
            "due to code sharing with cathay pacific i was downgraded to ba on my return leg i can’t describe how cheated i felt i booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment food and service instead i was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible to ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts the cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “you won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know ” the entertainment is compiled mainly of b movies so i paid £11 for wi fi so i could watch netflix on my laptop unsurprisingly the signal was so weak i couldn’t even send an email to add insult to injury the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality i have ever seen since the last time i used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful what i don’t understand is why it seems that british airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew\n",
            "lhr check in was quick at the first wing and quickly through security the first lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available while ba have brought back their highlife magazine in the lounge it seems they used covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer as part of the endless ba cost cutting the toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date the public washrooms in t5 are better and cleaner boarding was the usual ba muddled mess and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight requesting passengers to check in bags only to get on a flight that was less than 40 full onboard a very good welcome from captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard no hot towels or even packet towels offered in club europe any more another part of the relentless ba cost cutting i wouldn t mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre covid cabin staff service was perfunctory at best not a scrap of recognition for ba gold or oneworld emerald members clear proof that ba really don t care any more breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight paid £4 99 for 1 hours wifi and dropped connection for the next 40 mins sad to note that staff service on ryanair is more pro active nowadays priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at malaga this is standard for ba business class baggage handling do not waste your money on club europe standards just keep dropping\n",
            "i wouldn t recommend british airways at all i tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and i waited for more than 30 minutes on the phone i ended hanging up they are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls i write an email an i am still waiting for 2 weeks website is difficult to navigate it is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service they sent you online but you don t receive a pdf file so if you need a proof of flight you need to do screenshots and once the flight is flown you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a pdf you need to contact with a customer service which i did it online long waiting time and had to wait more than a week to receive it expensive and poor almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website an airline that definitely wouldn t recommend it is such a shame that in 2023 they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around\n",
            "absolutely horrible experience i booked a ticket from expedia for a british airways operated flight from madrid to belfast with a changeover at london heathrow the whole itinerary was listed as ba although the madrid to london flight was iberia on jan 22nd london was experiencing cold and fog the iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in madrid because of the london weather upon landing in terminal 3 i had to take a bus to terminal 5 the flight was the last flight to belfast for the evening and it had already taken off the ba desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather the british airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed i was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab however when trying to get the reimbursement ba said it wasn t their problem and that it was iberia s problem iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather when complaining to ba they said they only market the flight as ba and that they refuse to reimburse absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don t want to take responsibility for it did they expect me to take the bus back to terminal 3 their people gave out false information\n",
            "this is the worst airline not one thing went right i don’t understand how they have got it so bad late take off no gate when we arrived bags took over 40 minutes to arrive horrendous\n",
            "i will never fly british airways again to start the plane was over 2 hours late with no weather and no reason given the boarding process was chaotic both in the airport and onto the plane but more importantly although we were in business class it wasn’t really business class there were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there and those seats like the rest were extremely cramped and uncomfortable i could not believe they called this business class\n",
            "worst aircraft i have ever flown the seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over 1000each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a 10 hour flight is not acceptable my food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile i would not entertain using ba again ground staff were great it’s the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down we expected so much more\n",
            "i enjoyed my flight the boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional the food selection was good and i enjoyed the quality the was only one downside when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at t5 so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took 30 minutes i believe the heathrow t5 were having strike action that week\n",
            "why do you make it so hard after a so so lounge experience the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contempt it can’t be training who would do that it has to be no fear of anything happening the “new” club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy the crew were professional but i personally found the food menu rather odd essentially there was one only main that i could handle and was then told they had ran out i was a few rows in\n",
            "after several delays and canceled flights we finally made it to copenhagen on american airlines and british airways flights my luggage was destroyed wheels torn off i had to buy new luggage in denmark i made a claim with british airways to reimburse me but because i didn’t have the receipt for my old luggage they would only cover 50 of my new luggage advice have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you don’t get ripped off like i did\n",
            "literally the worst flight of my life after booking tickets together with my partner we were then separated ‘sorry the flight is full ’ the flight then took off 45 minutes late no apology the trolley service took over two hours and they periodically skipped rows and the response was flippant and rude ‘whoops not sure how that happened what do you want ’ genuinely appalling from beginning to end might as well fly easy jet at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service not like ba\n",
            "i swore i would never fly ba again after they messed me about so much when trying to get to budapest but the times for their flights suited me so i decided to give them another go the flight left on time just about the cabin was clean and the staff friendly there was even complimentary tea coffee and a breakfast bar to be had for economy the flight was pleasant enough and i can t think of any negatives to write about the flight and service was certainly head and shoulders above my trip with easyjet\n",
            "obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years prices have increased and services have gone down the most disappointing thing about ba is that aspects that really don’t need to get worse have the check in staff at heathrow are downright rude and abusive shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in asia where the service industry is next level i wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful however there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious\n",
            "lost 3 out of 4 checked bags denied wheelchair assistance at lhr for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by foot rude staff on ba297 from lhr to ord on april 05 2023 ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of water when walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely the ba staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat horrible flight with disappointing staff customer service is terrible and online check in never worked because ba never verified our covid documents which were uploaded in advance resulting me and my wife seated separately i’ve lost respect for british airways disgusted\n",
            "i have flown with ba for many years and there was a time about 10 years ago when they were getting better sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines at booking time one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat at heathrow t5 check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least the lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and ba has not invested in them for many years on the flight the food was okay although portions are kept minimal this was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight next time they change ceo can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate budget irish airline\n",
            "boarding at mumbai was chaotic and badly organised once on board the crew announcements were professional relaxed and informative in typical ba style the seat was quite comfortable it was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good i was lucky that the middle seat was empty so i didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which i think would have made it a lot less comfortable the ife is excellent responsive and good quality there is an enormous selection of tv and movies and a good number of games wifi is also very good not quite netflix quality but still reasonable and i don’t think £17 99 for full flight is bad value you can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight the small but tasty pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough landing and processing at heathrow was astonishingly quick it felt like it was 3am even though it was 6 30pm no queues or waiting at all even the baggage was super quick at coming through overall a very solid experience in economy significantly better than it used to be\n",

            "probably the worst business class experience i ve ever had on an airline just a few of the issues required to purchase seats on international club world business class this was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional 600 on a single leg lhr lax for a family of four given the very strange business class seating layout on ba a380s leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft on my vie lhr leg the boarding time for the a320 was over 50 minutes long leading to a delayed departure there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal 5 at heathrow boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding i have no idea why not and so crowding was extreme the overall boarding area was far too small for an a380 and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first a380s were delivered online check in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken i was urged repeatedly on the ba website and via email and text to upload my covid documents even though at the end of 2022 there are no covid documents required for travel after i filled in basic contact information on the website and did not upload any covid documentation i was informed several hours later that my covid documents have been verified i then received another text message urging me to upload my covid documentation on the vie lhr leg the shop ba com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times over six hours and then four hours just before landing ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty that said the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline onboard food and beverage service was far below average for international business class terrible one might say on the lhr lax leg there was no pre meal beverage service and there were no mid flight beverage services at all unlike most business class offerings on other airlines there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off with the chicken or fish type of meal selection similar to economy class there was no coffee or tea service after meals food quality was poor with the pre landing snack of a ploughman s lunch being downright disgusting there was no beverage or bar set up in the galley areas beverages available to passengers during the flight as is standard on most international business class offerings even bottles of water seemed be hidden away requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water i won t comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a380 as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating the seats are not 6 2 long as stated on the ba website and i found the seats too short for my 6 2 height the priority luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery\n",
            "definitely not recommended especially for business class the seats are ridiculous and small the food is mediocre if that and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight the service however has been great my attendant saved me from crying i don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space i’ve unfortunately traveled british airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months never again unless there is no other choice by the way the business class lounge south at heathrow is a cattle pen\n",

            "i must admit like many others i tend to avoid ba long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews but had my first ride on a ba a380 the other day so it was an exception what can i say aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that’s about it ife didn’t work but wasn’t that interesting anyway i got the map screenshot for a while lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down some skirts some trouser suits some long sleeves some short some jackets some waistcoat some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better i think baggage delivery was really quick summing up well i am still not coming back to ba not yet maybe the old charm will return soon\n",

            "a great flight the suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort british has returned to full service so meals were coursed menus and hot towels provided…etc food was quite good with choices provided for both meals service was ok i prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that’s my preference entertainment was good as was connectivity no real complaints except a minor one the tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position i actually felt like i was in a true business class not by qatar’s standards but that’s another story\n",

            "lhr lax i prefer the boeing 777 over the a380 as the seats don t seem too cramped check in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at heathrow t5 is a whole other story once through security its up the escalator up the stairs up the elevator down the escalator get to the gate no seating then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane i have been in and out of heathrow many times but never in t5 before anyway cabin crew were pleasant drinks and meal service were fine it was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight the entertainment system was good with decent options so i occupied my time with several movies nice landing at lax all in all ba was just fine\n",

            "our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland barely edible and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past the staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals no snacks were offered during the flight this is so different to every other airline we have used in the past after 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny cold stale ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of oreos if ever you decide to fly with them i suggest that you bring your own food we certainly will on our return flight but will never use british airways again\n",

            "return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency our outbound trip in december was good in all respects whereas the return trip was disappointing check in was fine apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority resulting in a long wait for our third bag the lounge was busy but no complaints we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen where there was no sign of activity although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate i checked on the flight radar app which showed that our aircraft had started in durban and flown to cape town port elizabeth back to cape town and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430 60 minutes late drinks service only started 30 minutes later followed by lunch the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre and not up to club standards with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine lunch service was quick but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew\n",

            "i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on british airways from detroit to bangalore and back given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers i decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket i was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i was special because i spent that extra money or was in business class from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys the trump was being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn some special passengers were escorted to the club world check in when we asked the lady she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up needless to say it never did finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked so i come back to the question can big corporations lie with no accountability why would i spend my hard earned money on something that gave me nothing extra shame on you british airways for your complete disregard for your passengers stop your lying or update your promises\n",
            "i have flown with ba for many years and today was another poor experience as i’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub par service i understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but ba’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted enormous queues at jfk ba check in terminal 7 even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights terrible efficiency at the check in counters at times only one member of staff is processing people whilst other ba staff stood around on their phones or having a chat one member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in the interior of the plane was generally filthy crumbs bits of food stains marks all around the seating area they give you a single wet wipe which i used to think was for your hands but now i see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area there are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally on this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight very poor i used to be a proud ba flyer but now i just feel like i’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days\n",
            "the entertainment selection was sub par minimal selections and the new releases were not new releases my food left something to be desired two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work the plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold find a medium temp just overall a very basic generic airline\n",
            "straightforward and friendly baggage drop on to south lounge no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1 5m distancing had to roam the entire lounge lugging our bags on the carpeted floor with no success at all gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around menu was basic with no eggs hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins ordered a frittata as was so hungry made my way to the self serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that dxb flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart however the doors cannot close till take off i asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the menu and it took them over an hour lunch came in another almost hour asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person said will surely try but clearly didn’t with no apologies or even trying portions were small plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished chocolates are lindor nothing special about the other amenities toilets were no different to what you’d expect amenity kit was basic duvet seemed well used it was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket naive to trust claims of world class standards\n",
            "on arrival at the warsaw airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board we had to guess and ask random people where to go once we finally found the check in desks luggage drop and check in was appalling it took us over 1 5 hours to get our bags checked and we were half way through the queue the whole process was disorganised and very slow really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small impatient kids lady in warsaw airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless one check in desk for euro traveller club europe one for bag drop and one for the check in flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay crew on the plane was nice and attentive luckily the in air experience was much better but sort out your ground service at warsaw airport\n",
            "in glasgow one check in desk open huge queue with no business check in it took me close to an hour to bagdrop getting onto the aircraft in glasgow no hello from the crew and the same getting off i normally find ba cabin crew very nice breakfast was a very tired looking croissant i used the ba lounge in terminal 3 not very keen on the new table service poor choice and miniscule portions lounge staff were very nice in both directions on arrival at lhr there was a coach transfer from t5 to t3 we were packed in like sardines so much for social distancing the flight from lhr to pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers no drinks or anything offered while we waited food was not even worth mentioning as far as club europe goes it s not worth the extra cost no priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in pisa seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off the first officer summed it up when we arrived in pisa sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by ba and he was right for the return trip on hogmanay we left on time i ve never been on a flight to or from pisa which has left in time pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable on board i gave the food a miss heathrow back to glasgow flight left on time food was an antipasto of some sort which i declined both cases were last off again club europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin i would have thought that ba would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is\n",
            "after two years of being unable to fly to our second home in south africa because of covid it was fantastic to be back on board a ba flight to cpt and in the club suite seats 1k and 2k to boot these seats are a huge improvement on the old yin yang cw seats in terms of privacy ease of access and the ife screen but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat storage was a mixed blessing too with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old cw meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above the food onboard was woeful although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn t dragged out cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm and there were the usual queues for the toilets the flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time cpt had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration it was good to be back\n",
            "i paid 1189 for a round trip flight to london and back in premium economy they bumped me from the seat for the flight back and told me i d be issued a refund instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different methods phone website twitter and finally email they told me i d be getting 229 16 back which is less than half of the 589 i paid for the upgrade instead they refunded 14 58 i emailed again and they told me i d be getting 115 16 more back when i emailed again saying that that doesn t add up to the original amount i was told i was getting they simply replied with that s the final amount turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of 14 58 and i was only getting 115 16 total so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they ve yet to respond so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i was calling for they hung up on me\n",
            "very nice return flight with ba to add to my previous review i really like how ba organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups this is super comfortable as 100 passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there the a320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus makes the 1 hour hop very comfortable once again amazing staff and they were even more attentive and accommodating to gold level passengers always coming and asking if any help is needed lovely humus beetroot and quinoa salad for food great wifi at really competitive pricing i think it is great that they also have food alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes domestic t5 arrivals is a breeze\n",
            "overall a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays lounge was ok quite worn out although staff and food were nice much better than when i travelled last time although the plane seemed old the cabin felt very fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking around 22 23c and had a funky lighting although seats are the same as those in economy they are pretty comfortable for a 1 hour hop much better than those at air france and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful for gold card passengers ba automatically reserves row 1 in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch the crew especially the purser were phenomenal extremely friendly adaptive to your needs and professional leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight sandwiches and scones were tasty i am actually a fan of well presented however simpler meals on board to my opinion they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust for a quick hop ba ticked all the marks here in comparison on a cdg lhr leg air france presented a ‘chic’ cold starter however to me it looked a bit too complicated and except from the duck terrine rather unappetising klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box one big drawback was the first wing experience at t5 the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead it’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers their companies spend to earn a gold status nevertheless the flight and most importantly the crew completely negated that drawback the flight was £200 one way £600 return incl transfer to kirkwall which was pretty expensive however the service seemed like it was worth the money\n",
            "first of this was one of the smoothest uk to us flights i have taken the boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all they called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which i appreciate why but why call families the worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling the entertainment system is basic it does not support bluetooth headphones the usb does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless the crew were nice so sorry i missed that\n",
            "flying during covid is always a challenge ba’s verifly app worked perfectly and on line check in was seamless the bags drop at t5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean the cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed friendly and keen to please we were offered two drinks before lunch was served with more drinks with the meal the food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing obviously it was only economy but after 8 hours flying i arrived relaxed and unstressed\n",
            "flew to nashville via chicago in first excellent check in and security lounge was good food and drink choices very good first cabin on 787 is 8 seats comfortable seat entertainment a little clunky cabin service top banana food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft a special call out to stewart tim a credit to ba\n",
            "i had low expectations of business class ba on european routes but this flight was even worse t5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late check in guy seemed clueless about turkey needs for pcr etc ba lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round boarding was chaos and we left an hour late a320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat there is no inflight screen no overhead screen although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back the only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise i would avoid flying ba the next day i flew the same aircraft type to bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen headphones good food and drinks arabic coffee dates and gracious service ba hang your head in shame\n",
            "we ve just used the new club world for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration the privacy afforded is so much better in flight entertainment and storage were brilliant unfortunately we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared the wines were warm they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet heathrow was a nightmare as often happens being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40 minute wait for a gate then a 2 5 hour wait for our luggage absolutely shocking in covid times\n",
            "my flight yesterday 18 12 2021 was due to take off at 1215 soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre boarding then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at aberdeen due to poor weather airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the ba app we then had to join a line for the customer service desk it took two hours to reach the desk in my case on reaching the desk i was told i had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel that did not meet my needs so i requested cancellation and to get my bags back i was told to cancel my booking on the ba app they could not do it at the desk i was then directed via a gate to collect my bags this meant having to go via the uk border to reach a baggage belt then i waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight ba staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day\n",
            "it is first time we have flown ba business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last firstly the check in and crew were great friendly and helpful it was manual check in not a machine which is always much nicer no complaints at all in that department food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter or desert and 3 choices for main course business class seating is 2 4 2 with alternate seats facing backwards as are both the centre seats we were in those so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat or you put the screen up and you are in a claustrophobic bubble you cannot see out you cannot see other passengers it was slightly better as it was my wife and myself but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger nowhere to put a glass bottle of water book or glasses within easy reach unless you keep the table down in most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing but there is nowhere to put a bag so everything has to go in the overhead locker and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats so not much storage space we were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2 now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case but normally if as a couple you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner s legs not some stranger i am 5ft 10 and could just about manage my wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind the reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all this is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid ba in future if at all possible\n",
            "i claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of august they took almost 4 months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons i have sent them a complaint per e mail and i still didn t get a reply it has been 4 5 months and i am still waiting for an answer furthermore many people were not wearing masks and when i asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions when we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves what a business class customer service\n",
            "british airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons we had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights ba did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled i am not going to travel on ba again and may not travel again this year at all\n",

            "british airways seems happy to encourage the spread of covid took the 7am flight from t5 at heathrow to paris cdg on 22nd november which was boarded by bus from a remote gate the bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full the result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms a second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it it is shameful that ba ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process and whilst the flight was okay this serves to underline how ba seem happy to disregard any covid 19 safety protocols in the airport environment in contrast on recent air france and iberia flights their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to covid that now prevails in the uk\n",

            "what has happened to british airways the whole pre flight experience now is prehistoric they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue on the premise it’s due to covid precautions they are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff like the post office in 1980 apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace i’ve chosen and insisted upon ba for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles i also have not one but two ba amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much i’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years in the last year i’ve booked 6 ba flights 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines the personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks that cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation a couple of weeks ago i noticed that one of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov 12th this year so i tried to speak to them as the world has largely been closed since march 20 i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher i’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline i’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and i’ve cancelled my ba amex i work in the music business managing tours for bands so i reckon i book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the worlds favourite airline but now the most ridiculed who’d have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive option\n",
            "i have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review the flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer however on this occasion it was an absolute delight on both inward and outward journeys i was impressed by the professionalism friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew i was in economy but was treated with the respect and service i would expect in the first class cabin my particular thanks must go to amir who was absolute joy and a credit to british airways i cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge thank you so so much\n",

            "a journey of 2 halves before hand multiple lies and lack of information from the ba website they cancelled my flight but they weren t honest about what they had done and lied they claimed that i could re book and showed lots of flights none were in fact scheduled to fly but ba claimed that they were full then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that all journeys complete website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the usa to uk impossible to get through to ba in london usa ba much better a total wait of 1 hour 40 minutes to make 2 calls staff at the call centre efficient and helpful chaos at chicago as most passengers had american issued boarding passes for the ba flight to london and ba weren t accepting those boarding passes no explanation for the change in policy everyone i saw merely handed in the american boarding pass and was given a ba boarding pass on the plane the staff were excellent as usual food was good verging on very good breakfast a little small but tasty i even got a 2nd cup of tea journey smooth with some sleep i stopped flying ba for 10 years because the head office is so poor the staff on the ground are good but ba as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed e g over securing client s data telling passengers what is going on running a decent frequent flier programme design of the business cabin stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo and so on i only fly ba because of the lack of choice on most routes whenever there is an alternative i try that not american airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than ba\n",
            "i flew to vancouver mid march to see my mother then in hospital three days after arrival my mother passed away and i subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral i tried to manage my booking online as ba suggest but because i had bought a package that included car hire the ba site said i was unable to change this online and i had to call their customer services i spent over 19 hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online i set up conversations facebook and twitter they went unanswered on the second day of my telephone ordeal i actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in ‘holidays’ who said he couldn’t help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line when this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting i managed to blurt out my ref number nothing else… before that call was disconnected thankfully the one person i had briefly spoken to in the duty office that night then emailed me back and i was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight this change took about 10 15 minutes over a few emails but the person helping me couldn’t extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected the only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company but two days previously when i tried to manage my booking online i was told i couldn’t do this because i had bought a package and that this could only be done by ba i do totally understand the turmoil caused by covid 19 but never again ba\n",
            "very disappointed that ba are not making it straightforward to claim a refund on cancelled flights back due to covid 19 effectively holding onto my money illegally do what’s right and make it straightforward to do it online a voucher is not sufficient or get more phone operators the virus is stressful enough without you making to check your site for updates and a 2 hour wait on the phone very disappointed i expect much better from you\n",

            "cpt is definitely getting its act together ba s galleries lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once the upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in club world that s despite the ancient yin yang seats and the tiny ife screen with appalling resolution the new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious the dinner service was according to the new cw soft design which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually on the whole i think it works and having the triple bread roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it rather than served with the dessert breakfast has been streamlined too and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff apart from some inevitable turbulence the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule a good flight overall but an old style business class experience\n",
            "sofia to belfast via london the legroom on the sofia to heathrow flight was terrible i am not tall but my knees were pushing against the seat in front service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices where did the service go there was a bad delay on the belfast flight we were not allowed to re enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault as we had gone through security only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re enter the lounge service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what ba was sending us via texts the delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes just short enough to avoid compensation the belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the 3 hour flight from sofia i will never set foot on this airline again\n",

            "i was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle during the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating so my initial impression was disappointed for business class however into the flight i found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back i was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available and i needed to ask for a pillow the menu guide was on cheap paper and with no convenient place to store it for reference later was very ordinary the evening meal was acceptable soup steak veg fruits was ok served with freezing cold cutlery bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles asthma puffer or water bottle the breakfast of juice and cereal yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable the lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight overall i expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery the only business class addition feature that i appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep ba ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a qf 11 from singapore to brisbane insisting i needed to collect my luggage leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight i am 73 with some mobility problems requiring assistance so this was a worry for me when i arrived in singapore the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight\n",

            "gatwick to barbados return i normally travel on ba with low expectations with the result that i am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised the outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an ok cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful however the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in barbados before the virgin flight that was scheduled to leave gatwick five minutes before us with the result that we got through arrivals quickly the return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of ba with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years once again when you travel west to east the crew specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal the pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the pe cabin not a big deal but irritating non the less no bread was served with dinner despite there being butter on the plate so i presume it was missed my wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else which was fine however as the crew were serving the remaining meals there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys when they reached our row they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife s remaining food and lap although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid it also spilled on my kindle which thankfully had the cover closed a very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and i suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made my wife s wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner once again we landed on time which was a good thing overall the return flight was extremely poor\n",

            "gatwick to tenerife this aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring g medk is by far the most uncomfortable plane i have ever been on i paid extra for an extra leg room seat 12a because i always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight i reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal it was like sitting on concrete i would imagine that when this aircraft was new 2005 i believe the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding it was dreadful i took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in lanzarote which coupled with there being no passengers next to me made the flight in 11f a little more bearable staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time i returned at night ten days later i normally travel easyjet on this route but on this occasion i used some avios to make the flight less expensive easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these ba flights with their diminishing attitude to customer welfare i will not use ba on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by easyjet is in my experience far superior\n",
            "booked a flight through expedia for june 21019 from denver to paris via london on the promise that i could upgrade using avios after booking the flight and trying to upgrade was notified that i could not upgrade the flight due to how i purchased the ticket paid about 250 for early seat selection on both flights after buy up to the front of the plane was notified that my seats were changed to the back of the plane with no explanation but found out they gave the seats that i paid extra for to another party could request a refund but wouldn t honor what they had sold me in the first place they would not honor a refund either then i became ill and they chose not to refund my fare of 3380 plus paid for upgrades\n",
            "johannesburg to london i had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck the only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night ba has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them the business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat the difference is that it goes to a full bed there is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table as it was a late flight 10pm the crew decided not to offer pre dinner drinks i ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep big mistake you only get the appetiser tiny and the desert even smaller i was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew the trays are removed when everyone else finishes so much for getting more sleep the crew never came back until breakfast that flight was a total disappointment\n",
            "london to kuala lumpur this is my first time flying with ba to kuala lumpur on the dreamliner 787 was very excited for this trip as ba has made a come back to fly to malaysia after stopping the service for many years i paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room i absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice i made a complaint to the crew that my seat 30b has sunk and i felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it which didn t help either the tv screen on 30b was also not working and i didn t watch anything during the whole duration of the flight i would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time this will be my last time flying with ba unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps the a380 i am dreading on my next return flight back to london crews were friendly and helpful no fault with that\n",
            "los angeles to london heathrow very poor customer service i checked in 3 hours prior to my flight departure asked can i have aisle seat and she just said no i asked her why and she replied that they don’t have any in the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we don’t have space and you can put that underneath your seat they served dinner and said we don’t have any more chicken so you can have pasta i told him i don’t like pasta and do you have any vegetarian food he said the pasta is vegetarian\n",
            "our flight from seattle to london in november 6th was canceled due to technical problems after waiting at the airport for 9 hours and staying in the line for 4 hours the ba associate couldn’t find us any immediate flight they offered us a flight that would arrive in london late november 8th it would take us 16 hours since the purpose of trip was to present a paper in a conference in november 8 i would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive my trip was supposed to be 4 days so by the time of arrival i had to return in less than two days they advised us to cancel the flight and promised to refund our flight tickets as well as the expenses for our accommodation since it was to late to cancel our booking i filed a claim online based on their instruction the customer relation phone number is disconnected in fact the automatic voice mail says “please don’t chase a call” the website link they refer to for tracking the claim has an auto message that the link dose not exist after 1 5 months stressful attempt to connect with customer relations they finally responded by email to tell me that we are not going to receive any refund from them\n",
            "gatwick to barbados we flew out of gatwick on the 6th december and back on the 17th dec it started well in the newish 1st class lounge at the south terminal however the walk to the gate is miles it has to be almost 1 2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest the north terminal where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight the decor and layout is much much better i d guess ba got offered a cheaper deal to move to the s t my first impression was how badly the new 1st class is holding up there are scuff marks everywhere surface scratches bobbles of wear on the seat fabric it s probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10 in the wc there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains needs a paint job at least the motley flowers that ba removed some years ago to save costs but re instated are there they looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard much has been said about the seat being an up market business class and this is true it is not a true 1st class in the sense of what emirates and singapore airlines offer i have flown both in 1st the food is also business class quality more casual dining rather than fine dining taking one meal it starts with an amuse bouche one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese one tomato one bit of green stuff one straggly piece of prosciutto ham total cost about 30p outstanding i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan totally utterly boring my wife had the soup which she said was nice i then had jerk chicken dish it was just about okay the glassware and chinaware was okay the cutlery was poor quality the stuff you d expect in pizza express except the stuff in pizza express is better i accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so but there is so much ba could do to improve the cheap look of their premium product quality of presentation food champagne even the menu covers they trumpet the superb laurent perrier grand siecle champagne which retails at £120 a bottle its nice but we all know this is inferior to what most airline 1st class offer in krug £20 a bottle more the alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying yang club business class the world s most hated business class in the sky i m a businessman and i know i could run this airline better from a quality perspective from a price perspective if you bundle a 1st flight as part of a ba holiday it sort of works out okay ish the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women\n",
            "moscow to london fantastic first class service the moscow lounge was surprisingly good with excellent runway views quick boarding and i was escorted to my seat by the crew the new first seats on the 787 9 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product there s plenty of space a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space the 23 inch flatscreen ife screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones the dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic the best airline meal i ve had drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival the crew were very attentive and friendly with it a fantastic experience and i ll look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin\n",

            "bridgetown to gatwick booked our return flight in business club class at £1 000 each only to find ba want to charge an extra £80 each to choose our seats awful seating with their ying yang seating arranged like sardines in a tin poor cabin staff attitude i asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told we only do that in first class if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that i was almost asleep when i was disturbed by food drinks being passed through the serving hatch otherwise known as a privacy screen to the inner seat this happened 3 times a sort of sleep deprivation torture if you are expecting business class levels of service and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed\n",
            "glasgow to new york via london morning flight from gla to lhr was ok i really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights we left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to jfk on the jfk flight the service was fantastic the meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight we left and arrived on time the seat and legroom was fine my mothers ife didn t work and she was moved seat which she appreciated the cabin crew were very friendly\n",
            "sydney to london via singapore i m hugely disappointed with the business class trip the seating arrangements leave little to be desired i e if you are on the isle you re interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you refer to seat guru for more understanding service is slow and once you have your food good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes if you re next to the window you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat the drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive if you do get a drink be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray i had two drinks slip off the teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat dont get me started with the in flight entertainment or the lack of it after i watched two movies on a 24 hour flight i was scratching to find anything else decent to watch the new releases is a contradiction in terms there is very little priority giving to business class when boarding the plane sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats i would not recommend ba to anyone\n",
            "johannesburg to london in contrast to our excellent outbound experience inbound lacked the wow factor the cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding the dinner service was unremarkable too and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights my ife touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month sleep quality was reasonable although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant breakfast was pretty good arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic comair flight\n",
            "antigua to gatwick one of the worst business class experience entertainment system didn t work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution service super slow 2 3 crew to serve 48 business class passengers food bad beef over cooked mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed woke up 20min before landing and offered a yogurt\n",
            "gatwick to barbados first class was third rate a disgusting cabin crumbs on the seat dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls it looked as though it hadn t been properly cleaned for days poor service and an entertainment system from a different age i have avoided flying with ba for the last 20 years now i remember why avoid them if your route allows\n",
            "cape town to london very unimpressive amenities and service unless you have a bulkhead seat there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you there is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry on baggage except in the bin above the food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get my husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn t get the attention of steward to rectify i gave him one of the two sets on mine i on the other hand never got the main course i finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and over cooked\n",
            "bucharest to london they are not giving free food and drinks anymore you have to pay on short haul in bucharest they did not park at the terminal they shuttle us to and from the plane in the bus they are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because the flights are too busy avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used to i have no problem with ba turning into a budget airline but at least charge accordingly otherwise it feels like we re being scammed\n",
            "kuala lumpur to mexico city via london the journey from malaysia to mexico alone for business trip would be very boring however during my trip from london to mexico city on 2 dec 2018 it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me especially associated with muslim needs on food they are polite and talk to me with big smiles so when i returned back to malaysia and transit in london from mexico city on 5 dec 2018 i wished i will be able to meet them again hope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip\n",

            "i would like to compliment british airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight service from the crew and the food served before landing we were served with an afternoon tea plate that was a credit to the catering company overall a very enjoyable flight from london gatwick to tampa\n",
            "arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours during this time no clear information was available from the check in desk who were unable to confirm the delay or elsewhere at the airport over an hour after the flight should have taken off and after most people had purchased refreshments an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so no complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay we landed at gatwick minutes before the last train left meaning we then had to shell out £50 for a taxi home despite this ba refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours 2 hours 55 minutes to be exact and took over a month to respond to my request about it this airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements ba s transformation into an overpriced easyjet will not fly with them again\n",
